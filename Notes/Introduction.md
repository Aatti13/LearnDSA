## What are Data Structures?
  **Data Structure** is used for the Organisation, Management and storage of data in order to access it efficiently.

## Types of Data Structures:

  ### 1. Linear Data Structures
    1-D Data Structures e.g: Arrays, Linked-Lists, Stack, Queue
   #### Types of Linear Data Structures
    - Static Linear Data Structure (Constant length of input) e.g: Arrays
    - Dynamic Lineat Data Structure (Can be of any length) e.g: Linked-List, Stack, Queue
  ### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
    These are non 1-D Data structures used for storing data e.g: Tree, Graph
## Note
  These Data structures will be discussed individually
